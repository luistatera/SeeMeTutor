Choose Your Path: The Three Pillars
Before you write a single line, you need to plant your flag in one of these three categories. Which one speaks to your inner architect?

The Live Agent: Focus on the Live API. Think voice-enabled tutors that "see" a student's sketchbook or a support agent that doesn't freak out when you interrupt it.

The Creative Storyteller: This is about Interleaved Output. Don't just generate text; weave a tapestry of narration, inline imagery, and video in one fluid stream.

The UI Navigator: Use Gemini's multimodal power to interpret screens. Build an agent that "sees" a browser and clicks, scrolls, and automates like a human would.

Every project must use a Gemini model, be built via the Google GenAI SDK or ADK, and live on Google Cloud.

🗓️ The "No-Stress" Success Timeline
Don't wait until the final 48 hours. Make a schedule:

Today: Brainstorm. Don't just think "useful," think "magical." What can an agent do now that it couldn't do six months ago?
Tomorrow: Lock it in. Pick one idea and commit.
By beginning of March: Blueprint & Build. Map out your architecture diagram (how Gemini talks to your GCP backend) and start the heavy lifting.
Mid-March: The "Soft" Launch. Start your submission draft on the platform. Get your environment running on Google Cloud.
March 13th: Lights, Camera, Action. Record your demo. Remember: we want real-time features, not polished mockups.
The Deadline (March 16th): Final Push. Submit early. You can continue to tweak and polish your code until the clock strikes zero, but get that initial entry in!
🏆 The "Pro-Manager" Tips for Bonus Points
If you want to move from the middle of the pack to the podium, pay attention to the extras:

Show Your Work: Documentation is for the judges. A clear README and a solid architecture diagram go a long way.
Go Public: Write a blog post or record a "Build With Me" video using #GeminiLiveAgentChallenge. We love seeing the "why" behind your "how."
Automate Everything: Want to impress the judges? Show you’re building for scale, not just for a weekend.
🚀 Your Immediate Next Steps
Join the Discord: Great teams are built in the chat. Find your co-founder or a specialized designer there.
